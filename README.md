# conpigurator

Portmanteau of Configurator and Pigment

Lightweight JS library for changing CSS color properties on page with designated form fields

conpiguator.js uses vanilla javascript. So, it has no dependencies, but it is not IE compatible.

conpigurator.jquery.js is dependent on jQuery methods to become more succinct and provide IE compatibility. If you are already loading jQuery, this file has an even smaller footprint. If IE compatibility is necessary, jQuery + this file will have you conpigurating in a flash.

#v0.0.1 Notes
conpigurator has only been tested with full 6-digit Hexadecimal color values. RGB values and CSS color names are outright unsupported. 3-digit Hexes are untested.
